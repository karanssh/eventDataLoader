docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306  --name mariadb-data -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=karanTest -d mariadb:latest



Running and Stopping the Container
Docker allows us to restart a container with a single command:

docker restart mariadbtest
The container can also be stopped like this:

docker stop mariadbtest


In case we want to destroy a container, perhaps because the image does not suit our needs, we can stop it and then run:

docker rm mariadbtest
Note that the command above does not destroy the data volume that Docker has created for /var/lib/mysql. If you want to destroy the volume as well, use:

docker rm -v mariadbtest
